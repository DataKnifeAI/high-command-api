# This Database resource is optional if the database was created during cluster bootstrap.
# The cluster bootstrap (in postgres-cluster-example.yaml) already creates the 'highcommand' database.
# This resource is useful for managing additional databases or if you need to recreate the database.
#
# Deployment:
# kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-database-example.yaml
